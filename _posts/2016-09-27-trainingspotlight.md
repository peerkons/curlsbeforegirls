This will be a small series of overviews of different training programs.

First of all, what is PPL?

PPL stands for Push/Pull/Legs.

Quoting <a href="http://www.aworkoutroutine.com/push-pull-legs-split/">A workout routine</a>:

"The push/pull/legs split is a weight training schedule that revolves around splitting the body up into 3 groups: upper body pushing muscles, upper body pulling muscles and legs. Each group is then trained separately on its own workout day.

The “push” workout would train all of the upper body muscles that are involved in pushing exercises. This primarily includes Chest, Shoulders and Triceps.

The “pull” workout would train all of the upper body muscles that are involved in pulling exercises. This primarily includes Back and Biceps.

The “legs” workout would train the entire lower body. This primarily includes Quads, Hamstrings and Calves.
Beyond that, abs are probably most often trained with legs, but they can really be trained on any of the days just the same.

The main purpose and benefit of splitting the body up this way is that related muscle groups are trained together in the same workout. This is fantastic for preventing the type of overlap issues that are so common with other less intelligent (or just plain stupid) splits.

For example, compound chest exercises like the bench press will always train the shoulders and triceps indirectly. So if you trained chest one day, and shoulders and triceps on some other day, the potential for problems is instantly increased.

However, by pairing up all of the muscle groups that get trained indirectly during exercises for other muscle groups, the push/pull/legs split greatly lessens that potential and almost idiot-proofs the overall structure of your routine. (The key word there is “almost,” as there will always be people dumb enough to screw up something that is borderline idiot-proof.)"

PPL is in no way a routine set in stone and you can adapt your routine in any way you like, e.g.:

P/P/L/Rest
P/L/P/Rest
P/P/L/P/P/L/Rest
And so on...
