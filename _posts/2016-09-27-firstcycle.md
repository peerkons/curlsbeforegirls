As we all know, the internet is full of information that can be misleading or flat out bullshit. Nobody wants to fuck up their health while hoping to grow large. Gains are important, but we must always take care of the safety side first and be as educated as possible. 

First of all, if you are ever planning to start cycling, the Reddit subreddit's "Steroids" wiki is usually recommended as a must read information source for beginners. 

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/index">https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/wiki/index</a>

The link is also in the side-bar if ever needed.

Furthermore, different sources recommend different starting ages for when should you start or how long should you wait before "hopping on the bike"?

Some will outright say to only do steroids if you are planning to compete, some will encourage to wait until 25 years of age, in some, the number will be 18 or 21 years. (Most pros start using steroids at an early age, so just keep that in mind)

In the end it is your own decision, but my advice is to do it only when you are 100% sure of what you are jumping in and what are the possible consequences.

So, to carry on about the whole cycle.

It is better to keep it simple with just the basics - testosterone (test). With the following cycles you can introduce other substances. This way you can see the side-effects of each substance and work accordingly.

Don't hop on trenbolone(tren) hoping to be ripped in a matter of minutes.

<a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/steroids/comments/4u7mwg/aftermath_of_16_week_tren_cycle/">A bad example of what can happen</a>

The first cycles recommended by the subreddit "Steroids" is:

"Weeks 1-12: Testosterone Enanthate, 250 mg, E3D

Weeks 13-14: Nothing (This allows the extraneous testosterone to clear your body).

On Hand Throughout Cycle: An AI like Arimidex or aromasin in case signs of excessive bloating or itchy nipples occur.

Alternatives/additives: Test E takes about six weeks to kick in. If you don't want to wait that long, you can add this:

Weeks 1-6: Dbol, 60 mg, ED"

So basically a standart test-e only cycle with an option of a dianabol(dbol) kickstart. In this cycle it is required to inject 250mg of test-e every 3 days.

Another good source for your first cycle is Reddit user's DLTBB's blog (also listed in the side-bar) <a href="bodymaxing.com">Bodymaxing</a>. The following cycle can be found there:

"Week 1-15

Test E – 2ml / 500mg E7D
Arimidex – 0.5mg EOD
HCG – 1000iu (500iu E3D)
3 weeks post final shot of Test start PCT (You can get all the information you need regarding PCT here)"


And another first cycle from an old post from <a href="https://forums.t-nation.com/t/steroid-newbie-cycle-planning/97187">T-Nation</a>:

Cycle Plan
W 1-10 Test Enth 250mg E3D
W 1-12 Adex 0.25mg EOD (reduce to 0.125mg EOD in last week)

This would be an example of a camp number 2 keep it simple cycle. You don't really need to get more complicated than this but if you want to below are some typical inclusions for a first cycle...

Optional secondary additions
W 1-4 Dbol 10mg 3x/d if you want an oral kickstart or just a little something extra thrown in mid cycle when your test is kicking in (seems most lately are going with the latter)
W 1-8 Deca 300mg/w if you want some additional bulking help
W 1-8 Tren Enth 150mg E3D if you want additional strength help
W 6-12 Proviron 25mg 2x/d if you want some help with libido

Optional Ancilliaries
W 1-12 Nolva 20mg/d if gyno symptoms (itchy/tender nipples) start to show
W 1-10 Caber 0.5mg 2x/w if you are having prolactin issues (difficulty getting an erection when on tren or deca)
W 3-10 HCG 250iu 3x/w if you want to prevent your nuts from shrinking and make recovery easier"

So read up, think about it, and happy juicing! Hope this helps a little with hopping on gear.
