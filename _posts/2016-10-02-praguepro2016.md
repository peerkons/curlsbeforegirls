<li>
First of all, I will start with a TL;DR of the placings.


<p>1.William Bonac</p>
<p>2.Big Ramy</p>
<p>3.Dexter Jackson</p>
<p>4.Shawn Rhoden</p>
<p>5.Roelly Winklaar</p>
<p>6.Lukas Osladil</p>
</li>

William Bonac was finally able to surpass Ramy, Dexter, as well as Shawn.

He came in as sharp and complete as always and that was what kept him ahead of everybody else. His improvement over the last years is tremendous and he is one of the people to watch the following years.

This time, Ramy's body took a toll on him. Too many back to back peaks were too much for him and Big Ramy wasn't as impressive as at the Kuwait Pro. He came in watery and soft in comparison. He was still able to place above Dexter, which is a huge feat for him regardless.

Third place - you guessed it! The Blade, Jackson. Coming in sharp as always, was able to place top3, but cut short of snatching a higher place. Question stands, for how long will he not age though?

Anyway, this year's Olympia was an improvement from last year, lineup-wise, and the following years will get more intense? Who and when will be able to bring down The Gift?
