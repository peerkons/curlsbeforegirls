The question of how much protein should be in one's daily diet has been topical since the beginning days of bodybuilding. Broscience and studies have shown the widest range of necessary protein for muscle gain/avoiding muscle loss.

This is so far the most useful source regarding this topic that I have found.

According to the studies mentioned in this slideshow, the required/optimal amount is **0.82 g/lb (1.8 g/kg)** of bodyweight regardless of cutting/bulking/maintaining. Furthermore, optimal intake decreases with training age. (The same data is found in the 2nd article, which claims that 1g/lb requirement is nothing more than a myth.)

The first reference - examine.com goes for a requirement of **0.68-1g/lb (1.5-2.2g/kg)** bodyweight when cutting, or **0.45-0.68g/lb (1.0-1.5g/kg)** bodyweight otherwise.

Lastly, the third reference recommends an amount of **0.64-0.9 g/lb (1.4-2.0 g/kg)** bodyweight for people doing high intensity training.



TL;DR:
	
**We won't get one ideal amount of necessary protein amount to be taken daily, as most researches come with different results, nonetheless, it looks like a range of 0.75-0.85g/lb or 1.65-1.87g/kg would be the ideal range in which to keep the protein intake in. Hopefully we will be able to verify which tests are closer to the truth in the future, but until then - this is something for which we should strive when looking for gaining/keeping muscle.**
